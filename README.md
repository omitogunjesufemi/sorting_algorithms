# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
This project was done by two students, which has help understand:
- atleast four different sorting algorithms
- Big O notation and how to evaluate the time complexity of an
  algorithm
- how to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- Stable sorting algorithm
